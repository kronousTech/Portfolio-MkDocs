## Role
Unity Developer

## Overview
*Due to NDA I can't share information about the project yet*

## Challenges
When I joined Kendir Studios, I contributed to an upcoming release by developing new features and game content, as well as fixing bugs to help polish the product for launch. I also created and reworked several internal tools to streamline workflows and significantly speed up development.
