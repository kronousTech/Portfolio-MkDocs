## Role
Unity Developer

## Overview
Codeverze was a platform that allowed clients to upload products online, which were then displayed within the Codeverze WebGL build as part of an interactive online store. The application was designed to showcase multiple online shops within a shared virtual environment, enabling users to browse products and make purchases directly inside the virtual world.

## Challenges
On this project, I was responsible for integrating the API and updating the frontend accordingly. As this was my first time doing so in a professional setting, it proved to be a significant learning experience, especially working alongside the Meridian Pulse team.

I was also in charge of implementing player movement and interaction within the store environment and its products, as well as developing tools such as object placement within the scene during playtime.
