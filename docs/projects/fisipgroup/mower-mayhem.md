## Challenges
One of the most significant challenges was maintaining and upgrading a project of this size and complexity for the first time. The process involved overcoming various technical and design hurdles, requiring both adaptability and a commitment to learning.

## Solutions
Through careful planning, consistent testing, and collaboration, I successfully maintained and enhanced the game. This experience taught me valuable lessons in project scalability, feature iteration, and problem-solving for long-term development.
