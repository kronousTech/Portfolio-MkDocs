## Overview
This project was developed for HTC Vive with the purpose of showing the clients machines in high detail as well as containing the necessary information.

## Technologies
SteamVR plugin and later in development Oculus SDK.

## Challenges
Given the intricate details of the machines, maintaining optimal performance became a significant challenge when presenting them and ensuring a stable frame rate.

## Solutions
To address the optimization challenges, we opted to display only one machine at a time and transition between them this ensured a stable and engaging user experience. This approach led to the creation of a sleek dissolve shader that you can see in action on a video to your right.
