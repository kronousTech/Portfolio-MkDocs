## Overview
Come travel back in time at Super Bock 'Casa da Cerveja', and follow how beer was made in our first brewing room, which now comes to life again through this immersive Augmented Reality experience.
The Super Bock 'Casa da Cerveja' is a tour circuit located right inside the Super Bock Group Production Center. On this journey through the world of beer, you will learn about its manufacturing process, from the raw materials that give rise to it, to the production of the wort, through fermentation and ending with the filling, where you can hear the clinking of the bottles.

## Challenges
The primary challenge for this project came from only being able to test in the museum environment. This constraint made the placement of models in the experience particularly challenging.

## Solutions
To aid in model placement, we developed a script that calculated the distance between the marker and the developer. This allowed us to save the position for later use during development when adding the models. While not flawless, it significantly expedited and simplified the initial placement of the models.
