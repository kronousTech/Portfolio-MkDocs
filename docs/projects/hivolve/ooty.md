## Overview
Developed for both Android and iOS, this project leverages the ArCore and ArKit frameworks to provide users with an engaging augmented reality (AR) experience. The app allows users to place products in their actual size for an immersive view or scale them down for a more comprehensive perspective. Additionally, users have the creative freedom to construct personalized houses using a custom editor. The primary goal of the app is to showcase the diverse collection of products offered by the client, combining functionality with a seamless AR interface.

## Technologies
ARKit and ARCore.

## Challenges

The main challenge for this app was devising a method to make it compatible with both iOS and Android by incorporating both the ARKit and ARCore plugins.

## Solutions
To enable this app to utilize both ARKit and ARCore plugins, I invested considerable time in thoroughly studying the documentation for both ARKit and ARCore. By identifying essential elements for app functionality, I integrated these scripts into the scene and adjusted them to coexist harmoniously. Additionally, I implemented a script to detect whether the app was developed for iOS or Android, enabling or disabling the necessary scripts accordingly.
