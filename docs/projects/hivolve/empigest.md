## Overview
This project was designed with the intent of showcasing the operational prowess of EMPIGEST's autonomous machines—innovative technologies that function seamlessly without the necessity of direct human control.

## Technologies
The project was developed for Google VR using its SDK for Unity.

## Challenges
In this project, I faced the task of making different machines work together smoothly. It was one of my first professional projects, and ensuring that these components didn't interfere with each other negatively proved to be quite a challenge.

## Solutions
To tackle this issue, I had to enhance my programming skills and develop the behavior of each machine with minimal dependencies to ensure a straightforward and smooth-running system.
