## Role
Unity Developer

## Overview
'Party Golf' is a game that I developed during my internship at hivolve. The game was inspired by the golf game 'Golf It' but following a party theme.

## Challenges
Though it's been quite a few years since my internship, I distinctly recall struggling with the physics of the golf ball and incorporating Ads into the game.

## Solutions
To overcome these challenges, I spent a significant amount of time delving into Unity documentation until I pinpointed the sources of these issues and could address them effectively.

## Lessons
Being my first mobile game I've developed at the time, it inspired me to learn more about how to create inputs via mobile screen, game optimization, ads and physics.
