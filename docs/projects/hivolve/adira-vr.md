## Overview
This project, for HTC Vive, was developed to showcase the client's machinery in intricate detail. The experience unfolds through dynamic animations, allowing users to witness the machines in action. Moreover, the immersive environment empowers users to actively engage with the machinery, allowing them to learn about the production process.

## Technologies
At first, we planned to use the SteamVR SDK for VR controls and interaction. However, as the project progressed, we switched to the Oculus Plugin because we decided to develop for the Oculus Quest 2 instead.

## Challenges
Due to the complexity of the machine models, performance issues quickly became present in the project.

## Solutions
To improve performance, several LOD's were created for the models present in the scene. With the addition of LOD's and a downgrade in the quality settings, we managed to maintain a consistent frame rate throughout the experience.
