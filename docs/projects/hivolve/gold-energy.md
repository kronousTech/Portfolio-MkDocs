## Overview
This compact project was created for a sustainable energy company within a tight three-day deadline. The objective was to craft an adventure for Goldy the gorilla. The result was an endless runner, drawing inspiration from games like Subway Surfers. Players control Goldy as they navigate side-to-side, jump, and roll to avoid obstacles, represented by a rolling tree trunk. The game features basic mechanics and employs randomly generated obstacles for a dynamic experience.

## Challenges
The main difficulties revolved around a tight deadline and the need to develop a procedurally generated system that could present obstacles for the player to dodge.

## Solutions
In my first year of professional work, facing a tight deadline for the first time prompted me to meticulously organize the tasks I had so I would be able to complete the development of the game. 

The incorporation of random obstacles posed both an entertaining and challenging aspect of the project. Since the character would be running around a spherical scenario, precise placement of obstacles with suitable distance and rotation was crucial to seamlessly integrate them into the scene without clipping with each other. Moreover, the obstacles would also need to disappear after the player dodges them to have room for new ones to spawn. This leads me to know more about object pooling and the benefits it was on optimization.
