## Overview
The primary objective of this project was to showcase diverse environments illuminated by various types of lighting. This was accomplished through a dynamic exploration of distinct 360-degree images, seamlessly adjusting their presentation in response to the selected lighting conditions.

## Challenges
In embarking on my first WebGL project, I encountered a range of new challenges related to optimization and build sizes. These challenges provided valuable learning opportunities, allowing me to deepen my understanding of WebGL development intricacies and refine my problem-solving skills.

## Solutions
To address the optimization and build size concerns, I began by reducing the quality of various images. In some cases, the default quality was unnecessarily high, and cutting it in half significantly reduced the build size. This adjustment resulted in smoother application performance with almost no noticeable difference in visual quality.
