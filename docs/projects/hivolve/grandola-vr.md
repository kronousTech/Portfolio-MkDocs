## Role
Unity Developer

## Client
Grândola's Municipal Chamber.

## Overview
This project showcases the traditional process of crafting clay pots, allowing players to experience each step, from gathering raw clay to shaping and eventually selling the finished pot.

## Challenges
Being a long experience, the main challenge involved establishing a system to incorporate multiple tasks for players. Each task required a clear condition and corresponding visual cues to guide the player. Additionally, there was a need for visual or auditory feedback upon task completion.

## Solutions
To address this challenge, I devised a script encompassing all scene tasks, iterating to the next one once the current task was finished. I established an abstract class for tasks, providing a flexible structure that allowed for creativity and expansion while maintaining a robust foundation.
