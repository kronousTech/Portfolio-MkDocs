## Role
Unity Developer

## Overview
This project was developed for the Valongo Municipal Chamber to showcase the city's rich tourist appeal. Its primary objective was to vividly portray the diverse attractions and cultural gems that contribute to the city's unique allure.

The narrative unfolded through a captivating series of immersive 360-degree videos.

## Challenges
The challenge in this project was to showcase a 360º video within a sphere, creating a fully immersive viewing experience.

## Solutions
To address this, we implemented a solution by incorporating a render texture into the sphere material. This render texture was also applied to the video player. While in retrospect, this solution seems straightforward, at the time, with less experience in Unity, it took some time to figure out.
