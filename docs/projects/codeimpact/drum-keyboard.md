## Role
Unity Developer

## Overview
<b>Keyboard</b> VR was a small project I contributed to, designed to allow users to type in virtual reality using drumsticks as an input method.

## Challenges
At the time, the client was experiencing issues implementing the keyboard package. I was responsible for resolving several bugs and adding new features, including text-to-speech functionality, customization options, and various 3D improvements to the keys and overall layout.
