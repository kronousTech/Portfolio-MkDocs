Unity Developer

## Overview
Immerse yourself in the immersive and adrenaline-pumping universe of DroneStrike VR, where you assume the pivotal role of a formidable defender tasked with safeguarding your base. Confront ceaseless hordes of enemy drones in a gripping and futuristic battle for survival. Your strategic prowess will be put to the test as you meticulously select from a wide-ranging arsenal, including precision-guided missiles and fearless kamikaze drones, all in the tireless pursuit of preserving your main tower from the brink of destruction.

Will you rise to the occasion and emerge as the triumphant victor in this epic virtual reality face-off? DroneStrike VR invites you to engage, strategize, and assert your dominance in the boundless skies of this extraordinary gaming experience.

In DroneStrike VR, players are entrusted with the mission of safeguarding their base against an onslaught of menacing enemy drones and a formidable array of weaponry aimed at undermining both player and opponent. Within the gaming environment, numerous vital assets await, each possessing distinct objectives. For example, an oil factory generates essential credits that fuel the acquisition of additional assets, while a radar system heightens the efficiency of drone detection. Air defense mechanisms act as a shield against incoming aerial threats, and an assortment of handheld weapons further bolsters the player's arsenal.

Notably, players must adopt a shrewd and tactical approach to vanquish their adversary. Strategic targets encompass the radar, oil factory, and air defense systems, and victory hinges upon dismantling these critical components. Triumph in battle propels players to subsequent levels, permitting them to carry forward the hard-earned credits accumulated through oil production. Astute management of these credits is imperative, as each ensuing level intensifies in complexity and introduces an array of new weaponry and challenges.

As you progress through the game, your prowess will be measured by the leaderboards, where points are calculated based on the remaining oil reserves and the extent of damage sustained by your base.

## Challenges
This was my first time working on a project of this scale, and I was the sole developer responsible for its development. One of the main challenges I faced was optimization—due to the large number of moving elements and multiple behaviors running simultaneously, performance issues quickly accumulated.

## Solutions
Gained hands-on experience using profiling tools to identify, analyze, and resolve complex behavioral and performance issues, including CPU bottlenecks, memory usage spikes, and inefficient update loops, resulting in improved stability and overall application performance.
