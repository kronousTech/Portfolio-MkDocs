## Info
A simple package with a WebGL template to make your build screen adapt to the browsers window size

## Solutions
As a solution, I delved into grasping the fundamentals of HTML programming, engaging in numerous trial-and-error attempts until I successfully developed a functional template.

## Lessons
In the process of publishing my package on the Unity Asset Store, I gained valuable insights into Unity's publishing guidelines. Additionally, delving into the code behind the WebGL templates provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the technical aspects involved in it.
