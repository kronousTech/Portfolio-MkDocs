## Info
Script Viewer is a Unity Editor tool that provides a visual, interactive map of all C# scripts within your project’s Assets folder. Designed for developers who want better visibility and control over their codebase, it offers a drag-and-zoom workspace where each script is represented as a movable, clickable node (box) displaying the script's name and namespace.

With support for live editing, coloring, and navigation, Script Viewer improves project maintainability and understanding—especially in large or modular Unity projects.
